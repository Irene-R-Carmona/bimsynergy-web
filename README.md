# BIMSynergy

**BIMSynergy** is a simulated, AI-powered platform that transforms traditional BIM (Building Information Modeling) models into intelligent digital twins. It combines real-time IoT data, machine learning analytics, and sustainability metrics to help improve building design, construction, and facility management throughout the building’s life.

> **Note:** This is a demonstration project. BIMSynergy is not a real commercial service.

## 🌟 What is BIMSynergy?

BIMSynergy shows how the future of building management could work. It connects BIM models with real-time data and artificial intelligence to help all teams—from architects to facility managers—work better together.

## 🏗️ The Problem

- The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry often has separate workflows and disconnected information.
- Most BIM solutions stop at the construction phase, but most building costs come during operation and maintenance.
- Facility managers have trouble with many different systems.
- Designers do not get real feedback about how their choices affect building performance.
- Sustainability analysis is complex and hard for most teams.
